# nlg
This is my pet project related to natural language generation (NLG) problem. Essentially, it's my attempt to create a poet's assistant: a model based on neural networks which would suggest rhymes, words and phrases according to a pattern. This project is 100% related to Russian language.  

# Hockey game result prediction
https://github.com/cscenter/khl

I participated in this project as a student's curator in [Computer Science Center](http://compscicenter.ru/). We developed a model for prediction of game result (held by [KHL hockey league](https://en.khl.ru)) which outperformed baseline model [develeoped by Joshua Weissbock](https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/31553/3/Weissbock_Joshua_2014_thesis.pdf) for NHL league games by 8%.
